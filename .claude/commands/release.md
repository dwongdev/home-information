Execute our complete release process following `docs/dev/workflow/release-process.md`:

## Release for version $0

I need to execute our standardized release process with the following requirements:

1. **Use TodoWrite to plan all release steps** - Break down the entire process into trackable tasks
2. **Pre-release verification** - Verify CI status, run `make check`, review recent changes
3. **Version management** - Update HI_VERSION file to `$0` and update CHANGELOG.md
4. **Git workflow** - Merge staging to master following our branch strategy
5. **GitHub release** - Create release using `gh` CLI with auto-generated notes
6. **Validation** - Check build artifacts, ZIP file size, and download URLs
7. **Cleanup** - Version bump to next dev version and return to staging
8. **Post-release guidance** - Provide monitoring checklist and next steps

**Critical requirements:**
- Follow exact process in `docs/dev/workflow/release-process.md`
- Handle errors gracefully with rollback guidance
- Verify all prerequisites before starting
- Validate each step before proceeding
- Use TodoWrite tool throughout for progress tracking

**Version to release:** $0
**Target branch:** master
**Source branch:** staging

Begin the release process now.
