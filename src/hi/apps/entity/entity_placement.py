"""
Entity placement: putting entities into LocationViews.

"Placement" is the union of (a) deciding what an entity should look
like in a view (a centered icon, a default path), (b) persisting the
chosen ``EntityPosition`` / ``EntityPath`` row, and (c) linking the
entity to the ``LocationView`` via an ``EntityView``. All three are
the responsibility of this module.

Two collaborating classes:

* ``EntityPlacementCalculator`` — orchestrates per-entity shape
  selection (Point vs Path), delegating "where in the SVG" to
  ``PositionGeometry`` and "how a path looks" to ``PathGeometry``.
  Performs no DB writes.

* ``EntityPlacer`` — DB-touching placer. Accepts either a
  pre-computed ``PlacementShape`` (e.g., from Phase 3's dispatcher
  modal that lays out an entire sync result group at once) or
  derives one via the calculator. Persists the result, links the
  entity to the view, manages delegates, owns un-place / toggle
  counterparts, and runs entity-type transitions.

Known limitation (carried over from earlier code, not introduced by
this module): when an entity carrying delegate entities is placed
into a view, the delegates are placed at the viewbox center
without any spread. Multiple delegates therefore overlap. Phase 3
inherits this behavior; revisit when it bites.
