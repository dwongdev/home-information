"""
Repair existing AlarmAction rows whose ``alarm_lifetime_secs`` was
set to zero by the previous "0 = until acknowledged" convention. The
alarm-queue layer never honored that intent — it treated zero as
"expires immediately", which made connectivity and battery alarms
silently vanish on creation.

Reverse path is intentionally a no-op, the original zero values are not
preserved (they were broken anyway).
