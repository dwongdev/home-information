"""
Framework-level periodic monitor for the Issue #283 sync-check
feature.

A single ``IntegrationSyncCheckMonitor`` runs at a long cadence
(``IntegrationSyncCheck.INTERVAL_SECS``, currently 4 hours), iterates
the enabled and unpaused integrations, gets each integration's
synchronizer via ``gateway.get_synchronizer()``, and dispatches to
its ``check_needs_sync()``. Sync-check rides on the same opt-in
surface as full sync — an integration without a synchronizer
naturally opts out of the periodic drift check too. Per-integration
calls are wrapped in try/except so one integration's transient
failure does not abort the cycle for the others. Sequential (not
parallel) iteration is deliberate: we hit one upstream at a time
across all integrations, which avoids lock-step CPU bursts when
monitors of multiple integrations would otherwise align at the long
boundary.

Lifecycle: started from ``IntegrationManager`` after the
per-integration health monitors have been launched. Stopped from the
same lifecycle. The first cycle runs immediately on start (the base
``PeriodicMonitor`` semantics) — that gives best-effort cache
population at server boot. Per-integration calls that fail because
their underlying manager / client is not yet ready are reported as
errors for this cycle only and the next cycle catches them.
