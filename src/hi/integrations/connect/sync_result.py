"""
Transient data shapes returned by integration sync operations.

The framework owns the sync workflow (pre-sync modal, sync view,
post-sync placement modal). Each integration's
``IntegrationSynchronizer.sync()`` returns an
``IntegrationSyncResult`` describing what happened during sync —
title, structured change counts, info/error notes — plus an
optional ``EntityPlacementInput`` that drives the placement modal
when the sync produced new entities to place.

The placement input shape lives in ``hi.apps.entity.entity_placement``
because it isn't sync-specific: any future flow that bulk-places
entities (e.g., a "place unplaced items" recovery feature) builds
the same shape from a different source. Sync is one supplier among
several.

The result modal renders a counts-driven lead summary
("N created, M updated, R removed") with per-category disclosures
that enumerate the affected items by name, plus collapsible
Details (``info_list``) and Errors (``error_list``) sections.
Counts are derived from list lengths — the lists are the source
of truth. ``info_list`` carries diagnostic context the per-item
lists can't express ("Found N upstream items", "Filtered N by
allowlist", etc.).

@dataclass
class IntegrationSyncResult:
    """Outcome of a single integration sync run.

    ``placement_input`` is None when the sync produced no new
    entities to place (the typical refresh-with-no-new-items case);
    populated when there's something for the placement modal to
    show. The framework uses presence/absence of placement_input —
    not emptiness checks against groups/ungrouped_items — to decide
    whether to show the placement.

    ``created_list`` / ``updated_list`` / ``reconnected_list`` /
    ``detached_list`` / ``removed_list`` hold the *names* of entities
    affected by this sync run, populated by the per-integration
    synchronizer as it walks upstream items. The result modal uses
    list length for the count badges and the list contents for
    per-category "Show items" disclosures so the operator can see
    which entities were touched. Names only — per-attribute change
    detail is intentionally not surfaced.

    The five categories are mutually exclusive for any given entity
    in a single sync run:
      * ``created_list``      — brand new entities this sync.
      * ``updated_list``      — existing primary-matched entities
                                whose payload changed.
      * ``reconnected_list``  — previously-detached entities that
                                were re-attached this sync (Issue
                                #281 auto-reconnect).
      * ``detached_list``     — entities preserved with user data on
                                this sync (sync-time preservation
                                or Disable-SAFE). They retain their
                                custom attributes / layout / etc.
                                and surface in the UI as "Detached
                                from <integration>".
      * ``removed_list``      — entities hard-deleted this sync.

    ``info_list`` carries diagnostic notes — "Found N upstream
    items", "Filtered N by allowlist", ambiguous-reconnect
    breadcrumbs — that the per-item lists can't express. Rendered
    as a collapsible Details section in the result modal.
    ``error_list`` is the parallel for failures.
