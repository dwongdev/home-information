"""
Per-integration sync-check state, and the integration-agnostic delta
primitive used to compute it.

Issue #283: a periodic background probe surfaces a "needs-sync"
signal when an integration's HI representation has drifted from
upstream. The probe never modifies entities — the user always
chooses when to invoke Refresh. Per-integration probe logic lives in
each ``IntegrationConnector.check_needs_sync()`` override, which
returns a ``SyncDelta``; sync-check rides on the same opt-in surface
as full sync (an integration without a synchronizer naturally opts
out of the periodic drift check too). The framework monitor wraps
the returned delta into a ``SyncCheckResult`` (delta + timestamp +
summary) and caches it. The cache entry is the *last known state of
the check*, not a "warning flag" — a successful Refresh records a
zero-delta result with a current timestamp so the UI can show
"verified up to date at HH:MM".

State is stored via ``django.core.cache`` (Redis-backed in
production); no DB model. Frozen dataclasses pickle cleanly through
the cache backend, so no custom serialization is needed; the cache
TTL bounds the impact of any class rename.
