"""
Per-integration connector base class.

The general integration framework owns the sync workflow (pre-sync
confirmation modal, sync execution view, post-sync placement modal).
The connector is the per-integration participant that the framework
hands off to for the integration-specific work plus a small amount of
peripheral metadata the framework surfaces alongside.

Each integration that supports sync provides a concrete subclass and
returns an instance of it from `IntegrationGateway.get_connector()`.
Sync is opt-in: a gateway whose integration does not support sync
returns None.
