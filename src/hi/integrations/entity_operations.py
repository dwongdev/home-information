"""
Operations on entities with respect to their integration attachment.

This module holds mutating operations (disconnect, preserve, detach) that
act on Entity instances relative to the integration that owns them. These
are distinct from the read-only analytical methods on EntityUserDataDetector.

EventDefinition cleanup (Issue #288) is integration-scoped and is
invoked here from both ``preserve_with_user_data`` and the hard-delete
branch of ``remove_entities_with_closure``. See
``EventDefinitionOperations`` for the policy: only EventDefinition rows
whose own ``integration_id`` matches are removed; user-owned
EventDefinitions referencing the entity's states are intentionally
left alone (deferred to the broader EventDefinition UX redesign).

        included. Each entity in the closure is then handled the

          * ``preserve_user_data=False`` (the DELETE ALL pattern):
            every entity in the closure is hard-deleted, including
            those with user-added data.

        Auto-reconnect candidate lookup (Issue #281). Pure read.

        Given a set of upstream IntegrationKeys that the
        synchronizer's primary-match step did NOT match, return a
        map of ``upstream_key → matching disconnected entity`` for
        every key that uniquely aligns with a disconnected entity's
        ``previous_integration_id`` / ``previous_integration_name``.

        Ambiguous matches (multiple disconnected entities sharing
        the same previous identity) are dropped from the result map.
        The issue's contract is to leave the duplicate for the user
        to resolve via merge (#263), since the system has no basis
        to pick one side over the other. A WARNING is logged and a
        breadcrumb is appended to ``result.info_list`` (when
        provided) for each ambiguous case so the operator can find
        them.

        The per-entity reconnect mutations and converter dispatch
        are deliberately NOT performed here. Callers (the
        per-integration synchronizers) own that step because each
        integration's converter has a different signature and
        callers also want to enrich ``result`` with their own
        operator-facing messages. ``strip_disconnected_prefix`` is
        provided as a shared helper for the name-cleanup step.

        ``(previous_integration_id, previous_integration_name__in=...)``
