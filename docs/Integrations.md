# Integrations

Home Information (HI) can optionally connect to external systems to
import items from them — alongside your own items and items from any
other integrations you enable. Integrations are not required; HI
works without any of them. Each integration has its own setup steps,
credentials, and caveats — see the per-integration page for details.

You will need credentials for the upstream service before starting;
the per-integration pages below cover what to obtain and where to
enter it.

## Enabling an integration

Most integrations are configured from the **Connectors** tab on the
Configure page. Content-source integrations (Paperless-ngx and
Immich) are configured from the **Content Sources** tab instead,
because they contribute searchable references rather than importing
items — see each integration's own page for the walkthrough.

For a Connectors-tab integration:

1. In HI, click **CONFIGURE** at the bottom of the screen.
2. Select the **Connectors** tab.
3. Open the integrations picker:
   - If no integrations are configured yet, click **CONFIGURE
     INTEGRATIONS** in the main panel.
   - If at least one integration is already configured, click
     **INTEGRATIONS** at the top of the sidebar.
4. Choose the integration you want to add and follow the
   configuration steps on its per-integration page below.

## Available integrations

- **[Home Assistant](integrations/home-assistant.md)** — general-purpose
  home automation platform. Imports HA entities (lights, switches,
  sensors, cameras, climate devices, and more) and dispatches control
  actions back to HA.
- **[ZoneMinder](integrations/zoneminder.md)** — open-source video
  surveillance. Imports ZM monitors as cameras with motion sensors and
  function controllers; provides live stream playback in HI.
- **[Frigate](integrations/frigate.md)** — open-source NVR with
  object detection. Imports Frigate cameras with an object-presence
  sensor that drives event playback in HI.
- **[HomeBox](integrations/homebox.md)** — home inventory tracking.
  Imports HomeBox items as read-only HI items with custom fields and
  attached files (manuals, receipts, photos).
- **[Immich](integrations/immich.md)** — self-hosted photo and video
  library. Does not import items; instead lets you search Immich
  from inside HI and attach matching assets (appliance photos, room
  snapshots, serial-plate shots) as link references on items and
  Locations you already have.
- **[Paperless-ngx](integrations/paperless-ngx.md)** — document
  management. Does not import items; instead lets you search
  paperless from inside HI and attach matching documents (warranty
  PDFs, manuals, receipts) as link references on items and
  Locations you already have.

More integrations will be added as demand arises. The per-integration
pages each carry their own troubleshooting section that accretes
real-world fixes over time — start there if something is not working.

## Integrations vs. Data Import

Most integrations on this page are live: HI mirrors the upstream
system continuously and changes flow in via the update action.
Content-source integrations (Paperless-ngx, Immich) are a different
shape — they contribute attachable references rather than importing
items, and they talk to the upstream service only when the operator
opens the picker.

A separate feature, [Data Import](DataImport.md), is a one-time
copy with no ongoing upstream link. Some integrations (HomeBox
today) offer both options.
